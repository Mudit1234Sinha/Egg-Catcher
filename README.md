# Egg-Catcher
This is my third game which is also made using Tkinter library of Python and as the name suggests it's a cool Eggcatcher game

So, what we have to do is to catch the eggs which are falling from the sky in our basket and we get points for each catch

We have a life as well, with each dropped egg we lose one life

And as the game progresses the difficulty factor increases, i.e. the speed of the egg increases
